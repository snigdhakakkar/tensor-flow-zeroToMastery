    "We're going to be replicating the deep learning model behind the 2017 paper [PubMed 200k RCT: a Dataset for Sequenctial Sentence Classification in Medical Abstracts](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.06071).\n",
    "\n",
    "When it was released, the paper presented a new dataset called PubMed 200k RCT which consists of ~200,000 labelled Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) abstracts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the dataset was to explore the ability for NLP models to classify sentences which appear in sequential order.\n",
