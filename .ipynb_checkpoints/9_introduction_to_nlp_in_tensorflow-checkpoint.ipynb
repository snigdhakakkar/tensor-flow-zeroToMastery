    "The main goal of [natural language processing (NLP)](https://becominghuman.ai/a-simple-introduction-to-natural-language-processing-ea66a1747b32) is to derive information from natural language.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Natural language** is a broad term but you can consider it to cover any of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Text** (such as that contained in an email, blog post, book, Tweet)\n",
    "2. **Speech** (a conversation you have with a doctor, voice commands you give to a smart speaker)\n",
    "Under the umbrellas of text and speech there are many different things you might want to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're building an email application, you might want to scan incoming emails to see if they're spam or not spam (classification).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're trying to analyse customer feedback complaints, you might want to discover which section of your business they're for.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔑 Note: Both of these types of data are often referred to as sequences (a sentence is a sequence of words). So a common term you'll come across in NLP problems is called **seq2seq**, in other words, finding information in one sequence to produce another sequence (e.g. converting a speech command to a sequence of text-based steps).\n",
    "\n",
    "To get hands-on with NLP in TensorFlow, we're going to practice the steps we've used previously but this time with text data:\n",
    "\n",
    "Text -> turn into numbers -> build a model -> train the model to find patterns -> use patterns (make predictions)\n",
    "\n",
    " 📖 **Resource:** For a great overview of NLP and the different problems within it, read the article [A Simple Introduction to Natural Language Processing](https://becominghuman.ai/a-simple-introduction-to-natural-language-processing-ea66a1747b32).\n",

    "Wonderful! We've got a training set and a validation set containing Tweets and labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our **labels are in numerical form (0 and 1) but our Tweets are in string form.**\n",
    "\n",
    "🤔 **Question**: What do you think we have to do before we can use a machine learning algorithm with our text data?\n",
    "\n",
    "If you answered something along the lines of \"turn it into numbers\", you're correct. A machine learning algorithm requires its inputs to be in numerical form.\n",
    "\n",
    "In NLP, there are two main concepts for turning text into numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Tokenization** - A straight mapping from word or character or sub-word to a numerical value. There are three main levels of tokenization:\n",
    "1. Using **word-level tokenization** with the sentence \"I love TensorFlow\" might result in \"I\" being 0, \"love\" being 1 and \"TensorFlow\" being 2. In this case, every word in a sequence considered a single token.\n",
    "2. **Character-level tokenization**, such as converting the letters A-Z to values 1-26. In this case, every character in a sequence considered a single token.\n",
    "3. **Sub-word tokenization** is in between word-level and character-level tokenization. It involves breaking invidual words into smaller parts and then converting those smaller parts into numbers. For example, \"my favourite food is pineapple pizza\" might become \"my, fav, avour, rite, fo, oo, od, is, pin, ine, app, le, piz, za\". After doing this, these sub-words would then be mapped to a numerical value. In this case, every word could be considered multiple tokens.\n",
    "* **Embeddings** - An embedding is a representation of natural language which can be learned. Representation comes in the form of a feature vector. For example, the word \"dance\" could be represented by the 5-dimensional vector [-0.8547, 0.4559, -0.3332, 0.9877, 0.1112]. It's important to note here, the size of the feature vector is tuneable. There are two ways to use embeddings:\n",
    "1. **Create your own embedding** - Once your text has been turned into numbers (required for an embedding), you can put them through an embedding layer (such as `tf.keras.layers.Embedding`) and an embedding representation will be learned during model training.\n",
    "2. **Reuse a pre-learned embedding** - Many pre-trained embeddings exist online. These pre-trained embeddings have often been learned on large corpuses of text (such as all of Wikipedia) and thus have a good underlying representation of natural language. You can use a `pre-trained embedding` to initialize your model and fine-tune it to your own specific task."

    "* **max_tokens** - The maximum number of words in your vocabulary (e.g. 20000 or the number of unique words in your text), includes a value for OOV (out of vocabulary) tokens.\n",
    "* **standardize** - Method for standardizing text. Default is \"lower_and_strip_punctuation\" which lowers text and removes all punctuation marks.\n",
    "* **split** - How to split text, default is \"whitespace\" which splits on spaces.\n",
    "* **ngrams** - How many words to contain per token split, for example, ngrams=2 splits tokens into continuous sequences of 2.\n",
    "* **output_mode** - How to output tokens, can be \"int\" (integer mapping), \"binary\" (one-hot encoding), \"count\" or \"tf-idf\". See documentation for more.\n",
    "* **output_sequence_length** - Length of tokenized sequence to output. For example, if output_sequence_length=150, all tokenized sequences will be 150 tokens long.\n",
    "* **pad_to_max_tokens** - Defaults to False, if True, the output feature axis will be padded to max_tokens even if the number of unique tokens in the vocabulary is less than max_tokens. Only valid in certain modes, see docs for more.\n",

    "## Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN's)\n",
    "\n",
    "For our next series of modelling experiments we're going to be using a special kind of neural network called a **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The premise of an RNN is simple: *use information from the past to help you with the future (this is where the term recurrent comes from)*. In other words, take an input (X) and compute an output (y) based on all previous inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "This concept is especially helpful when dealing with sequences such as passages of natural language text (such as our Tweets).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, when you read this sentence, you take into context the previous words when deciphering the meaning of the current word dog.\n",
    "\n",
    "See what happened there?\n",
    "\n",
    "I put the word \"dog\" at the end which is a valid word but it doesn't make sense in the context of the rest of the sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "When an RNN looks at a sequence of text (already in numerical form), the patterns it learns are continually updated based on the order of the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a simple example, take two sentences:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Massive earthquake last week, no?\n",
    "* No massive earthquake last week.\n",
    "Both contain exactly the same words but have different meaning. The order of the words determines the meaning (one could argue punctuation marks also dictate the meaning but for simplicity sake, let's stay focused on the words).\n",
    "\n",
    "Recurrent neural networks can be used for a number of sequence-based problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **One to one**: one input, one output, such as image classification.\n",
    "* **One to many**: one input, many outputs, such as image captioning (image input, a sequence of text as caption output).\n",
    "* **Many to one**: many inputs, one outputs, such as text classification (classifying a Tweet as real diaster or not real diaster).\n",
    "* **Many to many**: many inputs, many outputs, such as machine translation (translating English to Spanish) or speech to text (audio wave as input, text as output).\n",
    "\n",
    "When you come across RNN's in the wild, you'll most likely come across variants of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Long short-term memory cells (LSTMs).\n",
    "* Gated recurrent units (GRUs).\n",
    "* Bidirectional RNN's (passes forward and backward along a sequence, left to right and right to left).\n",
    "\n",
    "Going into the details of each these is beyond the scope of this notebook (we're going to focus on using them instead), the main thing you should know for now is that they've proven very effective at modelling sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a deeper understanding of what's happening behind the scenes of the code we're about to write, I'd recommend the following resources:\n",
    "\n",
    "📖 **Resources**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [MIT Deep Learning Lecture on Recurrent Neural Networks](https://youtu.be/SEnXr6v2ifU) - explains the background of recurrent neural networks and introduces LSTMs.\n",
    "2. [The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks by Andrej Karpathy](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/) - demonstrates the power of RNN's with examples generating various sequences.\n",
    "3. [Understanding LSTMs](https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/) by Chris Olah - an in-depth (and technical) look at the mechanics of the LSTM cell, possibly the most popular RNN building block.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model 2: LSTM\n",
    "\n",
    "With all this talk of what RNN's are and what they're good for, I'm sure you're eager to build one.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to start with an `LSTM-powered RNN`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To harness the power of the LSTM cell (LSTM cell and LSTM layer are often used interchangably) in TensorFlow, we'll use `tensorflow.keras.layers.LSTM()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "![rnnLSTM.png](Images/rnnLSTM.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Our model is going to take on a very similar structure to `model_1`:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input (text) -> Tokenize -> Embedding -> Layers -> Output (label probability)\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference will be that we're going to add an LSTM layer between our embedding and output.\n",
    "\n",
    "And to make sure we're not getting reusing trained embeddings (this would involve data leakage between models, leading to an uneven comparison later on), we'll create another embedding layer (`model_2_embedding`) for our model. The `text_vectorizer` layer can be reused since it doesn't get updated during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔑 **Note**: The reason we use a new embedding layer for each model is since the embedding layer is a learned representation of words (as numbers), if we were to use the same embedding layer (`embedding_1`) for each model, we'd be mixing what one model learned with the next. And because we want to compare our models later on, starting them with their own embedding layer each time is a better idea."

    "\n",
    "You might've used convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for images before but they can also be used for sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between using CNNs for images and sequences is the shape of the data. Images come in 2-dimensions (height x width) where as sequences are often 1-dimensional (a string of text).\n",
    "\n",
    "So to use CNNs with sequences, we use a 1-dimensional convolution instead of a 2-dimensional convolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical CNN architecture for sequences will look like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Inputs (text) -> Tokenization -> Embedding -> Layers -> Outputs (class probabilities)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You might be thinking \"that just looks like the architecture layout we've been using for the other models...\"\n",
    "\n",
    "And you'd be right.\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference again is in the layers component. Instead of using an LSTM or GRU cell, we're going to use a `tensorflow.keras.layers.Conv1D()` layer followed by a `tensorflow.keras.layers.GlobablMaxPool1D()` layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "📖 **Resource**: The intuition here is explained succinctly in the paper Understanding Convolutional Neural Networks for Text Classification, where they state that CNNs classify text through the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. 1-dimensional convolving filters are used as ngram detectors, each filter specializing in a closely-related family of ngrams (an ngram is a collection of n-words, for example, an ngram of 5 might result in \"hello, my name is Daniel\").\n",
    "2. Max-pooling over time extracts the relevant ngrams for making a decision.\n",
    "3. The rest of the network classifies the text based on this information.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model 5: Conv1D\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we build a full 1-dimensional CNN model, let's see a 1-dimensional convolutional layer (also called a temporal convolution) in action.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll first create an embedding of a sample of text and experiment passing it through a `Conv1D()` layer and `GlobalMaxPool1D()` layer."

    "For our next model, instead of using our own embedding layer, we're going to replace it with a pretrained embedding layer.\n",

    "More specifically, we're going to be using the [Universal Sentence Encoder](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D18-2029.pdf) from [TensorFlow Hub](https://tfhub.dev/google/universal-sentence-encoder/4) (a great resource containing a plethora of pretrained model resources for a variety of tasks).\n",
    "\n",
    "🔑 **Note**: There are many different pretrained text embedding options on TensorFlow Hub, however, some require different levels of text preprocessing than others. Best to experiment with a few and see which best suits your use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model 6: TensorFlow Hub Pretrained Sentence Encoder\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between the embedding layer we created and the Universal Sentence Encoder is that rather than create a word-level embedding, the Universal Sentence Encoder, as you might've guessed, creates a whole sentence-level embedding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our embedding layer also outputs an a 128 dimensional vector for each word, where as, the Universal Sentence Encoder outputs a 512 dimensional vector for each sentence."

    "## Combining our models (model ensembling/stacking)\n",
    "\n",
    "Many production systems use an **ensemble** (multiple different models combined) of models to make a prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind model stacking is that if several uncorrelated models agree on a prediction, then the prediction must be more robust than a prediction made by a singular model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The keyword in the sentence above is **uncorrelated**, which is another way of saying, different types of models. For example, in our case, we might combine our baseline, our bidirectional model and our TensorFlow Hub USE model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although these models are all trained on the same data, they all have a different way of finding patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we were to use three similarly trained models, such as three LSTM models, the predictions they output will likely be very similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it as trying to decide where to eat with your friends. If you all have similar tastes, you'll probably all pick the same restaurant. But if you've all got different tastes and still end up picking the same restaurant, the restaurant must be good.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we're working with a classification problem, there are a few of ways we can combine our models:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Averaging** - Take the output prediction probabilities of each model for each sample, combine them and then average them.\n",
    "2. **Majority vote (mode)** - Make class predictions with each of your models on all samples, the predicted class is the one in majority. For example, if three different models predict [1, 0, 1] respectively, the majority class is 1, therefore, that would be the predicted label.\n",
    "3. **Model stacking** - Take the outputs of each of your chosen models and use them as inputs to another model.\n",
    "📖 **Resource**: The above methods for model stacking/ensembling were adapted from Chapter 6 of the Machine Learning Engineering Book by Andriy Burkov. If you're looking to enter the field of machine learning engineering, not only building models but production-scale machine learning systems, I'd highly recommend reading it in its entirety.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, the concept of model stacking is best seen in action.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to combine our baseline model (`model_0`), LSTM model (`model_2`) and our USE model trained on the full training data (`model_6`) by averaging the combined prediction probabilities of each."
