    "The main goal of [natural language processing (NLP)](https://becominghuman.ai/a-simple-introduction-to-natural-language-processing-ea66a1747b32) is to derive information from natural language.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Natural language** is a broad term but you can consider it to cover any of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Text** (such as that contained in an email, blog post, book, Tweet)\n",
    "2. **Speech** (a conversation you have with a doctor, voice commands you give to a smart speaker)\n",
    "Under the umbrellas of text and speech there are many different things you might want to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're building an email application, you might want to scan incoming emails to see if they're spam or not spam (classification).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're trying to analyse customer feedback complaints, you might want to discover which section of your business they're for.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔑 Note: Both of these types of data are often referred to as sequences (a sentence is a sequence of words). So a common term you'll come across in NLP problems is called **seq2seq**, in other words, finding information in one sequence to produce another sequence (e.g. converting a speech command to a sequence of text-based steps).\n",
    "\n",
    "To get hands-on with NLP in TensorFlow, we're going to practice the steps we've used previously but this time with text data:\n",
    "\n",
    "Text -> turn into numbers -> build a model -> train the model to find patterns -> use patterns (make predictions)\n",
    "\n",
    " 📖 **Resource:** For a great overview of NLP and the different problems within it, read the article [A Simple Introduction to Natural Language Processing](https://becominghuman.ai/a-simple-introduction-to-natural-language-processing-ea66a1747b32).\n",

    "Wonderful! We've got a training set and a validation set containing Tweets and labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our **labels are in numerical form (0 and 1) but our Tweets are in string form.**\n",
    "\n",
    "🤔 **Question**: What do you think we have to do before we can use a machine learning algorithm with our text data?\n",
    "\n",
    "If you answered something along the lines of \"turn it into numbers\", you're correct. A machine learning algorithm requires its inputs to be in numerical form.\n",
    "\n",
    "In NLP, there are two main concepts for turning text into numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Tokenization** - A straight mapping from word or character or sub-word to a numerical value. There are three main levels of tokenization:\n",
    "1. Using **word-level tokenization** with the sentence \"I love TensorFlow\" might result in \"I\" being 0, \"love\" being 1 and \"TensorFlow\" being 2. In this case, every word in a sequence considered a single token.\n",
    "2. **Character-level tokenization**, such as converting the letters A-Z to values 1-26. In this case, every character in a sequence considered a single token.\n",
    "3. **Sub-word tokenization** is in between word-level and character-level tokenization. It involves breaking invidual words into smaller parts and then converting those smaller parts into numbers. For example, \"my favourite food is pineapple pizza\" might become \"my, fav, avour, rite, fo, oo, od, is, pin, ine, app, le, piz, za\". After doing this, these sub-words would then be mapped to a numerical value. In this case, every word could be considered multiple tokens.\n",
    "* **Embeddings** - An embedding is a representation of natural language which can be learned. Representation comes in the form of a feature vector. For example, the word \"dance\" could be represented by the 5-dimensional vector [-0.8547, 0.4559, -0.3332, 0.9877, 0.1112]. It's important to note here, the size of the feature vector is tuneable. There are two ways to use embeddings:\n",
    "1. **Create your own embedding** - Once your text has been turned into numbers (required for an embedding), you can put them through an embedding layer (such as `tf.keras.layers.Embedding`) and an embedding representation will be learned during model training.\n",
    "2. **Reuse a pre-learned embedding** - Many pre-trained embeddings exist online. These pre-trained embeddings have often been learned on large corpuses of text (such as all of Wikipedia) and thus have a good underlying representation of natural language. You can use a `pre-trained embedding` to initialize your model and fine-tune it to your own specific task."

You might even want to try stacking them (e.g. combining the outputs of your embedding layers using `[tf.keras.layers.concatenate](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/concatenate)`).\n",

    "* **max_tokens** - The maximum number of words in your vocabulary (e.g. 20000 or the number of unique words in your text), includes a value for OOV (out of vocabulary) tokens.\n",
    "* **standardize** - Method for standardizing text. Default is \"lower_and_strip_punctuation\" which lowers text and removes all punctuation marks.\n",
    "* **split** - How to split text, default is \"whitespace\" which splits on spaces.\n",
    "* **ngrams** - How many words to contain per token split, for example, ngrams=2 splits tokens into continuous sequences of 2.\n",
    "* **output_mode** - How to output tokens, can be \"int\" (integer mapping), \"binary\" (one-hot encoding), \"count\" or \"tf-idf\". See documentation for more.\n",
    "* **output_sequence_length** - Length of tokenized sequence to output. For example, if output_sequence_length=150, all tokenized sequences will be 150 tokens long.\n",
    "* **pad_to_max_tokens** - Defaults to False, if True, the output feature axis will be padded to max_tokens even if the number of unique tokens in the vocabulary is less than max_tokens. Only valid in certain modes, see docs for more.\n",
