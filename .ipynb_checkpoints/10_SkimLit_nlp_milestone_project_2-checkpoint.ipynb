    "🛠 **Exercise**: Another way of creating our positional embedding feature would be to combine the \"`line_number`\" and \"`total_lines`\" columns into one, for example a \"`line_position`\" column may contain values like 1_of_11, 2_of_11, etc. Where 1_of_11 would be the first line in an abstract 11 sentences long. After going through the following steps, you might want to revisit this positional embedding stage and see how a combined column of \"`line_position`\" goes against two separate columns."

Plus, only ~2,000/180,000 samples have a \"line_number\" value of over 15. So we would not be gaining much information about our data for doubling our feature space. This kind of problem is called the curse of dimensionality. However, since this we're working with deep models, it might be worth trying to throw as much information at the model as possible and seeing what happens. I'll leave exploring values of the depth parameter as an extension."

No single cause of PPD has been identified, however the increased risk of nutritional deficiencies incurred through the high nutritional requirements of pregnancy may play a role in the pathology of depressive symptoms. Three nutritional interventions have drawn particular interest as possible non-invasive and cost-effective prevention and/or treatment strategies for PPD; omega-3 (n-3) long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA), vitamin D and overall diet. We searched for meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials (RCT's) of nutritional interventions during the perinatal period with PPD as an outcome, and checked for any trials published subsequently to the meta-analyses. Fish oil: Eleven RCT's of prenatal fish oil supplementation RCT's show null and positive effects on PPD symptoms. Vitamin D: no relevant RCT's were identified, however seven observational studies of maternal vitamin D levels with PPD outcomes showed inconsistent associations. Diet: Two Australian RCT's with dietary advice interventions in pregnancy had a positive and null result on PPD. With the exception of fish oil, few RCT's with nutritional interventions during pregnancy assess PPD. Further research is needed to determine whether nutritional intervention strategies during pregnancy can protect against symptoms of PPD. Given the prevalence of PPD and ease of administering PPD measures, we recommend future prenatal nutritional RCT's include PPD as an outcome.\",\n",

       " {'abstract': 'Mental illness, including depression, anxiety and bipolar disorder, accounts for a significant proportion of global disability and poses a substantial social, economic and heath burden. Treatment is presently dominated by pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressants, and psychotherapy, such as cognitive behavioural therapy; however, such treatments avert less than half of the disease burden, suggesting that additional strategies are needed to prevent and treat mental disorders. There are now consistent mechanistic, observational and interventional data to suggest diet quality may be a modifiable risk factor for mental illness. This review provides an overview of the nutritional psychiatry field. It includes a discussion of the neurobiological mechanisms likely modulated by diet, the use of dietary and nutraceutical interventions in mental disorders, and recommendations for further research. Potential biological pathways related to mental disorders include inflammation, oxidative stress, the gut microbiome, epigenetic modifications and neuroplasticity. Consistent epidemiological evidence, particularly for depression, suggests an association between measures of diet quality and mental health, across multiple populations and age groups; these do not appear to be explained by other demographic, lifestyle factors or reverse causality. Our recently published intervention trial provides preliminary clinical evidence that dietary interventions in clinically diagnosed populations are feasible and can provide significant clinical benefit. Furthermore, nutraceuticals including n-3 fatty acids, folate, S-adenosylmethionine, N-acetyl cysteine and probiotics, among others, are promising avenues for future research. Continued research is now required to investigate the efficacy of intervention studies in large cohorts and within clinically relevant populations, particularly in patients with schizophrenia, bipolar and anxiety disorders.',\n",

       " {'abstract': \"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and alcoholic liver disease (ALD), either alone or in combination, count for more than two thirds of all liver diseases in the Western world. There is no safe level of drinking in HCV-infected patients and the most effective goal for these patients is total abstinence. Baclofen, a GABA(B) receptor agonist, represents a promising pharmacotherapy for alcohol dependence (AD). Previously, we performed a randomized clinical trial (RCT), which demonstrated the safety and efficacy of baclofen in patients affected by AD and cirrhosis. The goal of this post-hoc analysis was to explore baclofen's effect in a subgroup of alcohol-dependent HCV-infected cirrhotic patients. Any patient with HCV infection was selected for this analysis. Among the 84 subjects randomized in the main trial, 24 alcohol-dependent cirrhotic patients had a HCV infection; 12 received baclofen 10mg t.i.d. and 12 received placebo for 12-weeks. With respect to the placebo group (3/12, 25.0%), a significantly higher number of patients who achieved and maintained total alcohol abstinence was found in the baclofen group (10/12, 83.3%; p=0.0123). Furthermore, in the baclofen group, compared to placebo, there was a significantly higher increase in albumin values from baseline (p=0.0132) and a trend toward a significant reduction in INR levels from baseline (p=0.0716). In conclusion, baclofen was safe and significantly more effective than placebo in promoting alcohol abstinence, and improving some Liver Function Tests (LFTs) (i.e. albumin, INR) in alcohol-dependent HCV-infected cirrhotic patients. Baclofen may represent a clinically relevant alcohol pharmacotherapy for these patients.\",\n",

    "## 🛠 Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Train `model_5` on all of the data in the training dataset for as many epochs until it stops improving. Since this might take a while, you might want to use:\n",
    "* `tf.keras.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint` to save the model's best weights only.\n",
    "* `tf.keras.callbacks.EarlyStopping` to stop the model from training once the validation loss has stopped improving for ~3 epochs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Checkout the [Keras guide on using pretrained GloVe embeddings](https://keras.io/examples/nlp/pretrained_word_embeddings/). Can you get this working with one of our models?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Hint: You'll want to incorporate it with a custom token [Embedding layer](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Embedding).\n",
    "* It's up to you whether or not you fine-tune the GloVe embeddings or leave them frozen.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Try replacing the TensorFlow Hub Universal Sentence Encoder pretrained embedding for the [TensorFlow Hub BERT PubMed expert](https://tfhub.dev/google/experts/bert/pubmed/2) (a language model pretrained on PubMed texts) pretrained embedding. Does this effect results?\n",
    "* Note: Using the BERT PubMed expert pretrained embedding requires an extra preprocessing step for sequences (as detailed in the [TensorFlow Hub guide](https://tfhub.dev/google/experts/bert/pubmed/2)).\n",
    "* Does the BERT model beat the results mentioned in this paper? https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.06071.pdf\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What happens if you were to merge our `line_number` and `total_lines` features for each sequence? For example, created a X_of_Y feature instead? Does this effect model performance?\n",
    "* Another example: `line_number`=1 and `total_lines`=11 turns into `line_of_X`=1_of_11.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Write a function (or series of functions) to take a sample abstract string, preprocess it (in the same way our model has been trained), make a prediction on each sequence in the abstract and return the abstract in the format:\n",
    "* PREDICTED_LABEL: SEQUENCE\n",
    "* PREDICTED_LABEL: SEQUENCE\n",
    "* PREDICTED_LABEL: SEQUENCE\n",
    "* PREDICTED_LABEL: SEQUENCE\n",
    "...\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find your own unstrcutured RCT abstract from PubMed or try this one from: [Baclofen promotes alcohol abstinence in alcohol dependent cirrhotic patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22244707/).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📖 Extra-curriculum\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For more on working with text/spaCy, see [spaCy's advanced NLP course](https://course.spacy.io/en/). If you're going to be working on production-level NLP problems, you'll probably end up using spaCy.\n",
    "2. For another look at how to approach a text classification problem like the one we've just gone through, I'd suggest going through [Google's Machine Learning Course for text classification](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/guides/text-classification).\n",
    "3. Since our dataset has imbalanced classes (as with many real-world datasets), so it might be worth looking into the [TensorFlow guide for different methods to training a model with imbalanced classes](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/structured_data/imbalanced_data)."
