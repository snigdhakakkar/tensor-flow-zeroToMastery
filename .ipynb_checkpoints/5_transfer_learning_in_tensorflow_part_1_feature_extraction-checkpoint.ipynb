    "We've built a bunch of convolutional neural networks from scratch and they all seem to be learning, however, there is still plenty of room for improvement.\n",

    "\n",
    "Luckily, there's a technique we can use to save time.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's called **transfer learning**, in other words, taking the patterns (also called weights) another model has learned from another problem and using them for our own problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main benefits to using transfer learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Can leverage an existing neural network architecture proven to work on problems similar to our own.\n",
    "2. Can leverage a working neural network architecture which has already **learned patterns** on similar data to our own. This often results in achieving great results with less custom data.\n",
    "What this means is, instead of hand-crafting our own neural network architectures or building them from scratch, we can utilise models which have worked for others.\n",
    "\n",
    "And instead of training our own models from scratch on our own datasets, we can take the patterns a model has learned from datasets such as [ImageNet](http://www.image-net.org/) (millions of images of different objects) and use them as the foundation of our own. Doing this often leads to getting great results with less data.\n",

    "\n",
    "[Callbacks](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/callbacks) are extra functionality you can add to your models to be performed during or after training. Some of the most popular callbacks include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Experiment tracking with TensorBoard** - log the performance of multiple models and then view and compare these models in a visual way on TensorBoard (a dashboard for inspecting neural network parameters). Helpful to compare the results of different models on your data.\n",
    "* **Model checkpointing** - save your model as it trains so you can stop training if needed and come back to continue off where you left. Helpful if training takes a long time and can't be done in one sitting.\n",
    "* **Early stopping** - leave your model training for an arbitrary amount of time and have it stop training automatically when it ceases to improve. Helpful when you've got a large dataset and don't know how long training will take.\n",
    "We'll explore each of these overtime but for this notebook, we'll see how the TensorBoard callback can be used.\n",
    "\n",

    "Its main functionality is ```saving a model's training performance metrics to a specified log_dir```.\n",
