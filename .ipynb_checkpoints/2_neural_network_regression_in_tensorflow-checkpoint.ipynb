    "\n",
    "There are many definitions for a regression problem but in our case, we're going to simplify it to be: predicting a number.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you might want to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Predict the selling price of houses given information about them (such as number of rooms, size, number of bathrooms).\n",
    "* Predict the coordinates of a bounding box of an item in an image.\n",
    "* Predict the cost of medical insurance for an individual given their demographics (age, sex, gender, race).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we're going to set the foundations for how you can take a sample of inputs (this is your data), build a neural network to discover patterns in those inputs and then make a prediction (in the form of a number) based on those inputs."
