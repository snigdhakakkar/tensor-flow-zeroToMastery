    "\n",
    "There are many definitions for a regression problem but in our case, we're going to simplify it to be: predicting a number.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you might want to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Predict the selling price of houses given information about them (such as number of rooms, size, number of bathrooms).\n",
    "* Predict the coordinates of a bounding box of an item in an image.\n",
    "* Predict the cost of medical insurance for an individual given their demographics (age, sex, gender, race).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we're going to set the foundations for how you can take a sample of inputs (this is your data), build a neural network to discover patterns in those inputs and then make a prediction (in the form of a number) based on those inputs."

    "* Evaluating a model\n",
    "    * Visualizng the model (\"visualize, visualize, visualize\")\n",
    "    * Looking at training curves\n",

    "### Typical architecture of a regresison neural network\n",
    "\n",
    "The word typical is on purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "Because there are many different ways (actually, there's almost an infinite number of ways) to write neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the following is a generic setup for ingesting a collection of numbers, finding patterns in them and then outputing some kind of target number.\n",

    "Again, if you're new to neural networks and deep learning in general, much of the above table won't make sense. But don't worry, we'll be getting hands-on with all of it soon.\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ”‘ Note: A hyperparameter in machine learning is something a data analyst or developer can set themselves, where as a parameter usually describes something a model learns on its own (a value not explicitly set by an analyst).\n",

    "Okay, enough talk, let's get started writing code.\n",
