    "* Predict whether or not someone has heart disease based on their health parameters. This is called **binary classification** since there are only two options.\n",
    "* Decide whether a photo of is of food, a person or a dog. This is called **multi-class classification** since there are more than two options.\n",
    "* Predict what categories should be assigned to a Wikipedia article. This is called **multi-label classification** since a single article could have more than one category assigned.\n",
