    "## Convolutional Neural Networks and Computer Vision with Tensorflow\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we've covered the basics of TensorFlow and built a handful of models to work across different problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we're going to get specific and see how a special kind of neural network, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can be used for computer vision (detecting patterns in visual data).\n",
    "\n",
    "🔑 Note: In deep learning, many different kinds of model architectures can be used for different problems. For example, you could use a convolutional neural network for making predictions on image data and/or text data. However, in practice some architectures typically work better than others.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you might want to:\n",
    "\n",
    "Classify whether a picture of food contains pizza 🍕 or steak 🥩 (we're going to do this)\n",
    "Detect whether or not an object appears in an image (e.g. did a specific car pass through a security camera?)\n",
    "In this notebook, we're going to follow the TensorFlow modelling workflow we've been following so far whilst learning about how to build and use CNNs."

    "## Get the data\n",
    "\n",
    "Because convolutional neural networks work so well with images, to learn more about them, we're going to start with a dataset of images.\n",
    "\n",
    "The images we're going to work with are from the [Food-101 dataset](https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/datasets_extra/food-101/), a collection of 101 different categories of 101,000 (1000 images per category) real-world images of food dishes.\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, we're only going to use two of the categories, pizza 🍕 and steak 🥩 and build a binary classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔑 Note: To prepare the data we're using, [preprocessing steps](https://github.com/mrdbourke/tensorflow-deep-learning/blob/main/extras/image_data_modification.ipynb) such as, moving the images into different subset folders, have been done. To see these preprocessing steps check out the preprocessing notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll download the ```pizza_steak``` subset .zip file and unzip it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note for preprocessing steps:\n",

    "\n",
    "https://www.kaggle.com/kmader/food41\n",
    "https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/food-101 (this also works)\n",
    "However, the code below works on the first link's file structure.\n",

    "Once you've got the raw zip file, unzip it and put in the current working directory.\n",

    "10 class dataset of 10% of data (select random 10% of training data, keep test data the same)\n",
